## Notes

2. One of the objectives of this section is to install python with Anaconda. The instructor suggests downloading and installing Anaconda, however I knew that Anaconda is kind of "heavy". Since I do not want to occupy more space in the memor than what I need, I thought to give a chance to a different approach. Through my researched I decided to go with miniconda which
    > is a free minimal installer for conda

    as Conda documentation page states.
